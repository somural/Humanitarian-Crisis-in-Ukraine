The ongoing war in Ukraine led to a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of basic supplies. By analyzing real-time data we can gain critical insights into the needs of vulnerable populations, and make more informed decisions about how to invest and deliver our limited resources to respond. 
To support humanitarian actions in Ukraine, I:
1) map the conflict to identify areas most in need of assistance,
2) classify war-damaged infrastructure to target humanitarian response.
